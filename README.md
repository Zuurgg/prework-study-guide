## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: This prework study guide project is supposed to help me start coding by making it from the ground up, but it also contains notes that I took throughout the prework that will help me along the way. I made this to help me further my knowledge on coding and also help me understand the course material better. From making this I learned the basics of some of the coding languages that we will be using during this bootcamp.
